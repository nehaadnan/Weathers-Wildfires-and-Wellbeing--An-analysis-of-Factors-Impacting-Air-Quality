# Weathers-Wildfires-and-Wellbeing--An-analysis-of-Factors-Impacting-Air-Quality
Project Overview
This project investigates the interconnected impacts of climate change, wildfires, air quality, and public health. Given the increasing frequency and severity of wildfires in Canada due to climate change, the analysis explores how various environmental and meteorological factors influence both wildfire behavior and public health outcomes. The primary objective was to integrate and analyze data from five distinct datasets—wildfire incidents, weather conditions, air quality metrics, air pollutants, and public health data—to answer key research questions surrounding the impact of wildfires on air quality and health.

Methodology
The analysis began with the cleaning and preprocessing of data from five separate sources: wildfire, weather, air quality, and health datasets. Data was handled using Python, specifically with the Pandas library for cleaning, transforming, and organizing raw data into a usable format. Given the diverse nature of the datasets, special attention was given to handling missing values, removing outliers, and ensuring consistency across different time periods and variables.

Once the data was cleaned and prepared, SQL queries were written to join and filter the datasets, allowing for a more integrated view of the relationships between weather conditions, wildfire events, air quality levels, and health outcomes. This step was critical in exploring how different variables, such as temperature, precipitation, and PM2.5 levels, affected wildfire intensity, air quality, and respiratory health.

The next phase involved creating clear, informative visualizations to communicate the findings effectively. Using Seaborn and Matplotlib, a series of visualizations were produced to illustrate key trends and correlations, such as the impact of wildfires on air quality and the subsequent increase in emergency room visits for respiratory conditions. These visualizations helped to highlight significant patterns.
